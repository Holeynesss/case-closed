# case-closed
Just found a funny [website](leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/) which contains lots of algorithm questions. 
Most of the time when I read these questions, only one thought comes to my mind. --<strong>Why am I so stupid?</strong> <br/>
'Go to take some challenges and make your minds fly.' I told myself.
